# Carnival Gift Shop
Get familiar with JavaScript's fundamental syntax and create a simple program that utilizes variables, conditions, loops, and functions.
In this project, you will write the program to show the list of gifts, the tickets you have, and buy the gift you want.  
In addition, you will improve your JavaScript skills and get more comfortable with it!

## Stages
1. Use console logs, loops, and arrays to greet users and show the list of gifts they can purchase.
2. Practice with objects to store more information about gifts and show them in the console.
3. Get input from the user to perform various tasks and work with conditionals, switch cases, and numbers to output correct results.
4. Implement a condition to run your program continuously until users decide to quit.
5. Handle unexpected inputs that users may provide.
